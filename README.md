# Valentis Motors: Integrated Strategic Financial Planning & Analysis Suite

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive financial analysis and forecasting suite built for "Valentis Motors," a mock global automotive manufacturer producing both traditional (ICE) and electric (EV) vehicles. The suite provides end-to-end analytical capabilities, from data ingestion and preparation to multi-component forecasting, scenario analysis, and strategic budget optimization.

This portfolio piece demonstrates advanced skills in data engineering, time-series forecasting, financial modeling, and optimization to drive strategic business decisions.

## Key Features

*   **ETL Pipeline:** Scripts to extract data from source files (Excel), create a normalized relational schema in PostgreSQL, and load the data.
*   **Time-Series Forecasting:** Uses the Prophet library to forecast key financial components (e.g., revenue, COGS, operating expenses) while incorporating the impact of external economic indicators as regressors.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Models and compares a "Baseline" forecast against a "Tariff Scenario" to quantify the potential financial impact of external economic shocks.
*   **Budget Optimization:** Implements a linear programming model using PuLP to recommend optimal budget allocations across departments, maximizing a weighted score of ROI, operational efficiency, and strategic importance under different budget constraints.
*   **Competitor Benchmarking:** Includes scripts to fetch public financial data for real-world competitors (Ford, GM, Tesla) and calculate key financial ratios for comparative analysis.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (with `psycopg2` for connectivity)
*   **Forecasting:** Prophet (formerly Facebook Prophet)
*   **Optimization:** PuLP
*   **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
*   **Development Environment:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/valentis-motors-financial-suite.git
    cd valentis-motors-financial-suite
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    *   Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv .venv
      .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
      ```
    *   Install the required libraries:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3.  **Setup the Database:**
    *   Ensure you have PostgreSQL running.
    *   Create a database named `valentis_motors_db`.
    *   Set the environment variable `VALENTIS_DB_PASSWORD` to your PostgreSQL password.
    *   Run the data loading script (you will need the `Valentis_Motors_Data.xlsx` file, which is not included in this repo):
      ```bash
      python scripts/load_excel_to_postgres.py
      ```

4.  **Run the analysis scripts in order:**
    ```bash
    # (Optional) Fetch competitor data
    python scripts/competitor_financials.py
    python scripts/load_competitor_data.py
    
    # Main analysis workflow
    python scripts/cash_flow_forecasting_prep.py
    python scripts/run_baseline_forecast.py
    python scripts/calculate_benchmark_ratios.py
    python scripts/budget_optimizer.py
    ```

## Showcasing Results

Here are some of the outputs generated by the analysis suite.

### Baseline vs. Tariff Scenario Revenue Forecast

This chart visualizes the projected impact of trade tariffs on Valentis Motors' operating revenue.

### Optimized Budget Allocation

This demonstrates how the budget optimizer reallocates funds from a baseline budget to a more constrained tariff scenario budget, prioritizing departments with the highest strategic value.
